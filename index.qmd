# Scientific Machine Learning at the University of Leeds

Hi!

Welcome to the website for people interested in Scientific Machine Learning
(SciML) at Leeds. SciML is the discipline of combining machine learning with
scientific computing, for more information please see e.g. <a href="https://sciml.ai/roadmap/">sciml.ai</a>.
This website serves to organise our work and allow others to join us. 

If you're based at Leeds and would like to join, you can either:

  * Use the automated form [here](https://sciml-profileadder.streamlit.app)
  * Make a pull-request to add yourself to this website: [people.md](https://github.com/sciml-leeds/sciml-leeds.github.io/tree/master/_data/people.yaml)

We meet the first Friday of every month at 11am UK/local time in room 11.87, 11th Floor, Worsley Building, Leeds
Institute for Data Analytics (Use [.ics-file download](assets/SciML_community_monthly_coffee-chat.ics) to add
